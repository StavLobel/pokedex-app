# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a production-grade Pokédex web application that enables users to identify Pokémon through image recognition. The application will allow users to scan or upload images of Pokémon using their mobile devices, utilize AI-powered image recognition to identify the Pokémon, fetch detailed information from the PokéAPI, and display the results through a modern, responsive user interface. The system will be built following Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices, maintaining Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and SOLID principles, and will be deployed on a Hostinger VPS with proper CI/CD pipelines.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Image Upload and Capture

**User Story:** As a Pokémon enthusiast, I want to capture or upload images of Pokémon using my mobile device, so that I can quickly identify unknown Pokémon I encounter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL provide a camera interface for real-time image capture
2. WHEN a user chooses to upload an image THEN the system SHALL accept common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP) up to 10MB in size
3. WHEN an image is captured or selected THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the image before processing
4. WHEN an invalid file type is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the upload
5. IF the image file exceeds the size limit THEN the system SHALL compress the image or display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Pokémon Recognition

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically identify the Pokémon in my uploaded image, so that I don't need to manually search through hundreds of Pokémon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is submitted for recognition THEN the system SHALL process the image through an AI model within 10 seconds
2. WHEN the AI model processes an image THEN the system SHALL return the most likely Pokémon identification with a confidence score
3. IF the confidence score is below 70% THEN the system SHALL return the top 3 possible matches for user selection
4. WHEN no Pokémon is detected in the image THEN the system SHALL inform the user that no Pokémon was found
5. WHEN the AI model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry functionality

### Requirement 3: Pokémon Data Retrieval and Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see comprehensive information about the identified Pokémon, so that I can learn more about its characteristics, stats, and abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Pokémon is successfully identified THEN the system SHALL fetch data from PokéAPI including name, type, abilities, stats, and sprite images
2. WHEN Pokémon data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL display the information in a clean, mobile-friendly interface
3. WHEN displaying Pokémon information THEN the system SHALL include at least: name, Pokédex number, type(s), height, weight, abilities, and base stats
4. IF PokéAPI is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display cached data if available or an appropriate error message
5. WHEN data loading takes longer than 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with progress information

### Requirement 4: Responsive Mobile-First Design

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the application to work seamlessly on my smartphone with an intuitive interface, so that I can easily use it while on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads on any device THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for mobile screens
2. WHEN a user interacts with the camera feature THEN the system SHALL provide large, touch-friendly buttons and controls
3. WHEN displaying Pokémon information THEN the system SHALL organize content in a scrollable, card-based layout
4. WHEN the application is used in different orientations THEN the system SHALL maintain usability in both portrait and landscape modes
5. IF the device has limited screen space THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential information and provide expandable sections for details

### Requirement 5: Backend API Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust backend API that handles image processing and data retrieval efficiently, so that the application can scale and maintain good performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the backend SHALL accept POST requests with multipart/form-data encoding
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the backend SHALL implement proper error handling and return structured JSON responses
3. WHEN multiple users access the system simultaneously THEN the backend SHALL handle concurrent requests without performance degradation
4. WHEN integrating with external services THEN the backend SHALL implement retry logic and circuit breaker patterns
5. IF any backend service fails THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately and return meaningful error messages to the frontend

### Requirement 6: Production Deployment and DevOps

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be deployed securely and reliably on the Hostinger VPS with proper monitoring and CI/CD, so that it maintains high availability and can be updated safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL use Docker containers for both frontend and backend services
2. WHEN users access the application THEN the system SHALL serve content over HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
3. WHEN code changes are pushed to the main branch THEN the CI/CD pipeline SHALL automatically run tests, build, and deploy the application
4. WHEN the application is running in production THEN the system SHALL use Traefik as a reverse proxy for load balancing and SSL termination
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous working version and alert administrators

### Requirement 7: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage following TDD practices, so that the application is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are developed THEN the system SHALL have unit tests written before implementation
2. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage
3. WHEN integration tests execute THEN the system SHALL test API endpoints with mocked external dependencies
4. WHEN frontend tests run THEN the system SHALL test user interactions and component behavior
5. IF any test fails THEN the CI/CD pipeline SHALL prevent deployment and notify developers

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to respond quickly and handle multiple users efficiently, so that I have a smooth experience even during peak usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the initial page SHALL render within 3 seconds on a 3G connection
2. WHEN processing images THEN the recognition SHALL complete within 10 seconds for images up to 10MB
3. WHEN fetching Pokémon data THEN the API response SHALL return within 2 seconds
4. WHEN multiple users upload images simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain response times within acceptable limits
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the application SHALL implement request queuing and provide estimated wait times
